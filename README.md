# Downloading files

To download files we need a few things:
 - Correct folder structure for downloads
   - Folder **'androzoo'** in root of the project and inside it folder called 'dataset', which in turn has another two folders: **'benign'** nad **'malware'**
 - In 'androzoo' folder there has to be file called `list.csv`, which can be downloaded from https://androzoo.uni.lu/lists

To download files, first use `prepate-downloads.py`, which will create file called `to_download` in androzoo directory. This file contains list of hashes of .apk files that will be downloaded.

Next, use `download-apks.py` to download files. No all files will be downloaded correctly, so at the end script will remove corrupted ones.

While using `download-apks.py` you have to provide options to the script.
 - First option can be either **'truncate'** or **'keep'**. Truncate means that old files will be removed, keep means that old files will not be removed. While using truncate you have to specify second option which specifies what files to remove. It can be either **'malware'**, **'benign'** or **'both'**
